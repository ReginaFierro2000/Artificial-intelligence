Introduction:
The Tower of Hanoi test is a test that is used in neuropsychology to evaluate the executive functions of a child, adolescent and adult. 
The purpose of this test is to evaluate a person's planning, control, and organization abilities. The human brain performs planning as one of its executive functions. 
In other words, it refers to the ability of a subject to think about something concrete in advance. In order to plan effectively, you need to be able to evaluate and 
anticipate what may happen in the wake of your actions. Control is related to mastery, command or self-control over something. The ability to control impulses has to do with planning.
Experiences from the past are taken into account in the control. The result is that it is a preventive and corrective mechanism based on the past experiences of each subject and planning or projections for the future. Organization is the way in which a subject is planned in anticipation of a certain activity. For optimizing time and results, the way in which the subject organizes different tasks will be crucial. Consequently, the organization clearly requires experience, trial and error to improve it.

Playing this game involves moving an entire stack of disks from one place to another. Three simple rules are followed:
1.	Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2.	Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack. In other words, a disk can only be moved if it is the uppermost disk on a stack.
3.	No large disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.
